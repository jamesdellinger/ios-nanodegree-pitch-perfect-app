## Overview
This repository contains the Pitch Perfect app project for the **Intro to iOS App Development with Swift** course in Udacity's [iOS Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).

Pitch Perfect is an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.
