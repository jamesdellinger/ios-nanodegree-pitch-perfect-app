This repository contains the Pitch Perfect app project for the Intro to iOS App Development with Swift course in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

Pitch Perfect is an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.
